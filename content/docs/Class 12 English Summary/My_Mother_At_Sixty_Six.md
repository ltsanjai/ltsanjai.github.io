# My Mother at Sisty-Six

The poem "My Mother at Sixty-Six" talks about the poet’s feelings when she sees her mother growing old. It shows her love for her mother and her fear of losing her.

# Summary

The poet describes a car ride with her mother, who is sitting beside her. She notices her mother’s pale and tired face, which reminds her of an old, lifeless winter moon. This makes the poet sad as she realizes her mother is aging and might not live forever.

To avoid thinking about this, the poet looks out of the car window. She sees lively scenes like children playing and trees rushing by, which are full of energy and life, unlike her mother, who looks weak and quiet.

At the airport, as she says goodbye to her mother, the poet notices her pale face again. Even though she feels very emotional, she hides her sadness, smiles, and tells her mother they will meet again. Inside, however, she is deeply worried and upset about leaving her aging mother.
